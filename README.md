# ws-rpc-client
`ws-rpc-client` is a tiny WebSocket subprotocol that builds a request-response model onto HTML5 WebSockets using ES2015 Promises. You can use this with ES2016's `await`/`async` to simplify your WebSocket API. `ws-rpc-client` supports `node.js` and browsers. For more flexibility, have a look at [kdex/ws-promise-server](https://github.com/kdex/ws-promise-server) and [kdex/ws-promise-client](https://github.com/kdex/ws-promise-client).
